General Guidelines
==================
* Fair play for fun: It's up to each player to abide to the game rules to the best of his knowledge,
it makes no sense to "cheat", since the main point of the game is to have fun with friends and
immerse into the experience.

The Dungeon Guide
=================
Uses the virtualDungeon program to guide the adventuring party through the dungeon.

Stats
=====
There are 3 base stats which are determined by the player choice of Job/Class. The available choices
depend on the scenario being played.

* Strength
* Magic
* Dexterity

These 3 base stats are used by the game to calculate the following secondary stats:
* Max Hit Points = STR
* Max Magic Points = INT
* Evade Trap Chance = (DEX * 2)%

Status Ailments
===============
Combat or traps may cause a player to become injured or otherwise have his movement and combat
capabilities diminished; as always, it's up to each player to do fair play and assume the correct
behavior based on his status ailments.

Following is a list of status ailments and their required behavior.

* Blind: Must wear a blindfold.
* Paralyzed: Cannot move at all.
* Unconscious: Cannot move at all. Cannot talk nor cast spells. Must keep eyes closed.
* Asleep: Cannot move at all. Cannot talk nor cast spells. Must keep eyes closed.
* Mute: Cannot talk nor cast spells
* Poisoned: Must walk slowly and in pain
* Single Leg Injury: The player must move using only the other leg. When in battle the player may
choose to kneel over the injured leg.
* Both Legs Injury: The player must crawl around to move. When in battle the player may kneel in
both legs.
* Single Arm Injury: The player cannot use the injured hand.
* Both Arms Injury: The player cannot use his hands.
* Clamped: Player cannot move until battle is over, afterwards he sustains Single Leg Injury.

When a party member cannot move (Paralyzed or Unconscious for example), other party members should
carry him around when moving between rooms.

Blind party members should also be guided around to new rooms in order to complete a movement phase
successfully.

Party members might also help players with leg injuries or any other limiting ailment, but it is not
required.

All status ailments are temporary, the game will keep track of the time and let players know when
the status has expired.

Traps
=====
Traps found in the dungeon can cause any of the status ailments to one or more members of the party.

Some traps can be avoided with quick reaction by the player, in those cases, it's up to the dungeon
guide to determine what players for the party evaded the trap.

Players also have a chance to evade traps based on their Dexterity stat.

* Arrow traps: Injure a single body part to one or all party members. Can be avoided by quickly 
ducking.
* Poisoned arrow traps: Same as arrow traps, but may cause Poisoned status in addition to injury.
* Stun arrow traps: Same as arrow traps, but may cause Paralyzed status in addition to injury.
* Spikes, Clamping Traps, Caltrops, Pit traps: Cause damage to one or both legs. Can be avoided by
quickly jumping.
* Falling Rocks: Cause damage to one or both arms, or may cause unconsciousness. Can be avoided by 
quickly running to the next room.
* Bomb Traps: May cause injuries to any body part (and more than one), as well as unconsciousness.
* Powder traps: May cause Blindness, Paralysis, Asleep, Poisoned or Mute ailments. Can be avoided by
covering the nose, closing eyes and mouth quickly and crawling to the next room.
