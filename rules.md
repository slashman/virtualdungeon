General Guidelines
==================
* Fair play for fun: It's up to each player to abide to the game rules to the best of his knowledge,
it makes no sense to "cheat", since the main point of the game is to have fun with friends and
immerse into the experience.
* Performing and mimicking actions is encouraged.

The Game Team
=============
The game should be played by at least 2 players plus the Game Master.

* Game Master: Uses the virtualDungeon program to guide the adventuring party through the dungeon.
* The player's party: 1 to 4 players adventuring inside the dungeon
* The staff party: 1 to 4 players acting as monsters and NPCs into the dungeon.

The optimal setup is 8 players; if an 8 players party cannot be assembled, the following is the
suggested distribution:

Total Players     8 7 6 5 4 3 2
Player's Party    4 4 3 3 2 1 1
Staff             4 3 3 2 2 2 1

The game is better played if there are at least 5 players, it can potentially be played by any
number of players, but things may get out of hand.

1 - Main field: This is where most of the action happens, it is a big open space, about 25x25 
meters. Before starting the game, the Game Master prepares the field by placing markers on the
boundaries (2)
2 - Field boundaries: The Game Master uses these to properly locate the party on the playing field.
3 - The Dungeon Armory: The Staff Players await here for indications from the Dungeon Master to get
into battle; the armory contains equipment for both the players and the monsters to use.

Equipment
=========
Basic equipment for the game consists of:
* The VirtualDungeon game program, loaded on a portable device.
* One weapon for each player participating (At least 2, 8 is p)
* Shields for participating players (Optional)

          Minimum Setup     Optimal
Weapons         2              8
Shields         0              8

Stats
=====
There are 3 base stats which are determined by the player choice of Job/Class. The available choices
depend on the scenario being played.

* Strength
* Magic
* Dexterity

These 3 base stats are used by the game to calculate the following secondary stats:
* Max Hit Points = STR
* Max Magic Points = INT
* Evade Trap Chance = (DEX * 2)%

Status Ailments
===============
Combat or traps may cause a player to become injured or otherwise have his movement and combat
capabilities diminished; as always, it's up to each player to do fair play and assume the correct
behavior based on his status ailments.

Following is a list of status ailments and their required behavior.

* Blind: Must wear a blindfold.
* Paralyzed: Cannot move at all.
* Unconscious: Cannot move at all. Cannot talk nor cast spells. Must keep eyes closed.
* Asleep: Cannot move at all. Cannot talk nor cast spells. Must keep eyes closed.
* Mute: Cannot talk nor cast spells
* Poisoned: Must walk slowly and in pain
* Single Leg Injury: The player must move using only the other leg. When in battle the player may
choose to kneel over the injured leg.
* Both Legs Injury: The player must crawl around to move. When in battle the player may kneel in
both legs.
* Single Arm Injury: The player cannot use the injured hand.
* Both Arms Injury: The player cannot use his hands.
* Clamped: Player cannot move until battle is over, afterwards he sustains Single Leg Injury.

When a party member cannot move (Paralyzed or Unconscious for example), other party members should
carry him around when moving between rooms.

Blind party members should also be guided around to new rooms in order to complete a movement phase
successfully.

Party members might also help players with leg injuries or any other limiting ailment, but it is not
required.

All status ailments are temporary, the game will keep track of the time and let players know when
the status has expired.

Traps
=====
Traps found in the dungeon can cause any of the status ailments to one or more members of the party.

Some traps can be avoided with quick reaction by the player, in those cases, it's up to the dungeon
guide to determine what players for the party evaded the trap.

Players also have a chance to evade traps based on their Dexterity stat.

* Arrow traps: Injure a single body part to one or all party members. Can be avoided by quickly 
ducking.
* Poisoned arrow traps: Same as arrow traps, but may cause Poisoned status in addition to injury.
* Stun arrow traps: Same as arrow traps, but may cause Paralyzed status in addition to injury.
* Spikes, Clamping Traps, Caltrops, Pit traps: Cause damage to one or both legs. Can be avoided by
quickly jumping.
* Falling Rocks: Cause damage to one or both arms, or may cause unconsciousness. Can be avoided by 
quickly running to the next room.
* Bomb Traps: May cause injuries to any body part (and more than one), as well as unconsciousness.
* Powder traps: May cause Blindness, Paralysis, Asleep, Poisoned or Mute ailments. Can be avoided by
covering the nose, closing eyes and mouth quickly and crawling to the next room.

Starting Combat
===============
Combat in the game can happen in two different situations:

* Entering a room with enemies
* Waiting on a room ("Passing a turn") may make monsters show up

Whenever combat starts, the game will pick players from the staff in order from them to play as
monsters, assigning a monster race to each one of them, as well as their equipment (weapon type
and shield)

When one of the staff players is assigned as a monster, he may pick the mask representing the
monster race, as well as his equipment from the dungeon armory. He will then proceed to attack the
player's party.

Weapons
=======
All weapons inside the game are covered with foam. There may be different shapes and lengths to
simulate different types of weapons such as:
* Small weapons: Up to 30cm long
* Swords: Up to 50cm long
* Two Handed Weapons: Up to 100cm long

Shields
=======
Players may decide to wear a shield in exchange for a two handed weapon

Attack Styles
=============
Broadly speaking, there are three different kinds of attacks which can be used by players inside the
game; but it's up to the player to use the most effective fighting style based on the weapon type he
is wielding (it will not be strongly enforced).

* Slash: Cut the enemy with one side of the weapon. Effective for swords.
* Hack: Similar to slash, but also combining concussive effect. Effective for axes.
* Thrust: Pierce the enemy with the pointy end of the weapon. Effective for swords, daggers
and some polearms.
* Bash: Hit the enemy with either the sides or the tip of the weapon for concussion damage. 
Effective for hammers and maces.

Rules for Combat
================
The goal of the combat is to make soft contact with the enemy, reducing his hitpoints and taking
him down. Each successful hit reduces one hit point, regardless of the hit area.

Excessive agression is NOT allowed, neither are head hits. If a player feels another player is being
overly agressive he will notify the Game Master about it, and the player may be given a warning or
removed from the game.

When hit by an enemy on a leg or arm, that part becomes injured and cannot be used (as described in
the status ailments section). This applies to both players and monsters.

Monsters have a number of hitpoints when they are assigned, staff players should keep their hitpoint
count in mind, and drop to the floor when the player has defeated them.

Players also have a number of hitpoints; the game master will help keep track of them using the
game, and registering the hits he sees. Players keep track of their injuries the same way as 
monsters, but should also drop dead by command of the Game Master if notified.
