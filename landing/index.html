<h2>What is EXODUS</h2>
<p>EXODUS is a computer assisted dungeon crawling game framework. It generates random dungeon layouts
and challenges players to explore them, battling monsters and finding items on their way.</p>

<p>An EXODUS game is meant to be played on an open field at least 10x10 meters long, by a group of at
least two players. Each player takes a side either as the adventuring party or the dungeon dwellers,
which have the task of preventing the success of the adventurers. </p>
